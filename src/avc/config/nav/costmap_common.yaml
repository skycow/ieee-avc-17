# Sometimes, its useful to be able to run navigation solely in the odometric frame. To do this, I find the easiest thing to do is to copy my local_costmap_params.yaml file over my global_costmap_params.yaml file and change the the width and height of the map to be something more like 10 meters. This is a really easy way to get things up and running if you want to tune navigation independent of localization performance.
